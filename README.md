# Challenges-and-Solutions-SQL

## Overview:

* The project focuses on creating a database schema to manage employee information efficiently.
* Two main tables, 'employees' and 'departments,' are designed to store employee and department details.

## Key Tasks:

**Task 1:** Created the 'employees' table with essential columns like employee ID, name, position, salary, dates, department ID, and manager ID.

**Task 2:** Altered table columns to enforce data integrity and added default values for specific columns.

**Task 3:** Inserted sample data into the tables to populate them with employee and department information.

**Task 4:** Updated employee records, including job titles, salaries, and applying salary increments for specific positions.

**Task 5:** Executed queries to generate reports, such as displaying employee details, active status, and manager names.

**Task 6:** Created a view ('v_employees_info') to simplify data retrieval and provide a consolidated view of employee information.

**Task 7:** Analyzed average salaries across different job positions and divisions.

**Task 8:** Utilized window functions to generate additional insights, such as comparing employee salaries to the average salary for their position.

**Task 9:** Used window functions to calculate cumulative salaries over time for employees.

**Task 10:** Created a query to track the cumulative salary expense over time, including employee departures.

**Task 11:** Identified employees with the highest salaries within their respective positions and compared them to the average salaries.

**Task 12:** Generated a comprehensive report on department-wise employee count, total salary, and average salary.

**Task 13:** Introduced ranking functionality to determine the rank of employees based on their salary within each department.

**Task 14:** Filtered the results to display only the top-ranked employees within each department.
